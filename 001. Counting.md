# Counting

### Product Rule
> If there are `m` ways to do one thing, and `n` ways to do another thing, then there are `m * n` ways of doing both things.

##### Example
> How many possible binary strings of length `n` may exist?

E.g. for length of 3  
Possible strings: `000` `001` `010` `011` `100` `101` `110` `111`  
Answer: $2^3$ = 8

### Sum Rule
> If there are `m` ways to do one thing, and `n` ways to do another thing, and both can't be done at the same time, then there are `m` + `n` ways of doing only one of the things.

##### Example
> You can go to one of the 4 seminar rooms in SCIS L2, or one of the 4 seminar rooms in SCIS L3. How many possible rooms can you go to?

Answer: 4 + 4 = 8

### Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
> If two things can be done at the same time, the _Sum Rule_ will lead to double counting. Thus, we should add the no. of ways to do each task, and subtract the no. of ways to do both tasks.

### Permutation
> An ordered arrangement of a set of items

Given a set `T = {1,2,3}`, its permutations are:

- `1,2,3`
- `1,3,2`
- `2,1,3`
- `2,3,1`
- `3,1,2`
- `3,2,1`

No. of permutations is `n!`.

##### r-Permutation
> An ordered arrangement of `r` of the `n` items

Given a set `T = {1, 2, 3}`, its 2-permutations are:

- `1,2`
- `1,3`
- `2,1`
- `2,3`
- `3,1`
- `3,2`

No. of r-permutations is $^{n}P_{r}$ = $\frac{n!}{(n - r)!}$

### Combination
> An unordered arrangement of a set of items

Given a set `T = {1,2,3}`, its combination is:

- `1,2,3`

No. of combinations is `1`.

##### r-Combination
> An unordered selection of items

Given a set `T = {1,2,3}`,  its 2-combination is:

- `1,2`
- `1,3`
- `2,3`

No. of r-combinations is $^{n}C_{r}$ = $\frac{n!}{(n - r)!}$
