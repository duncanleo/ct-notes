| Notation      | Remarks           | Growth                                                |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| O(1)          | Constant time     | When `n` doubles, no. of operations remain the same   |
| O(n)          | Linear time       | When `n` doubles, no. of operations doubles           |
| O($\log_n$)   | Logarithmic time  | When `n` doubles, no. of operations increase by 1     |
| O($n \log_n$) | Linearithmic time |                                                       |
| O($n^k$)      | Polynomial time   |                                                       |
| O($k^n$)      | Exponential time  | When `n` increases by 1, the no. of operations double |
| O($n!$)       | Factorial time    |                                                       |
